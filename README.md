# LIBOR Market Model Calibration and Simulation

This project demonstrates the calibration and simulation of the LIBOR Market Model using hypothetical data.

## Steps:
1. **Data Generation**: A hypothetical dataset of swaption volatilities for various maturities is created.
2. **Calibration**: The model's constant volatility is calibrated to match the hypothetical swaption volatilities.
3. **Simulation**: The forward rate's dynamics are simulated using the calibrated volatility and the Euler-Maruyama method.

To run the project, execute the `libor_market_model.R` script in your R environment.
